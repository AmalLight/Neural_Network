3x2 * 2x3 = 3x3

(a1+b4) (a2+b5) (a3+b6)
(c1+d4) (c2+d5) (c3+d6)
(e1+f4) (e2+f5) (e3+f6)


1) I1 & I2 are Inputs.

2) In the dia graph I wrote X1 * a,b because I was making one simple FFNN of hidden size 2.

3) b is not used only from X2, Here a and b are totaly different for each of them.

4) a,b == hidden size for W1, so = 2.
